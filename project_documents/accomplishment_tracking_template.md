# [Your Name] - [Team name] Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals: Set up my project's Wire Frame and Prototype Designs via Figma **

**Activity:**

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned: A prototype of an app idea, can help organize execution of flow within a program being built up, 
this later helps with conceptualizing the Class architecture of the program and which relationships come into 
play in order for the program to work smoothly, this all comes together within the Plant UML diagram.**

## Week 2

**Goals: Map out the exchange of data in my program (what is the currency of information passed), and set up new database tables that will correlate to my program, via a database's CLI program.**

**Activity:**

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned: Using AWS CLI, and a command related to "CLOUDFORMATIONSTACKS", we can deploy directly via terminal, 
our new database tables to intiate via our Database Server, and what their PRIMARY KEY or unique identifiers will be. 
This able to be deployed with a YAML File that provides a server specific steps and values to set up within the table, 
in a format the database server will understand.**
